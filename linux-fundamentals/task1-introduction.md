Linux is just another operating system (like Windows or macOS). The main difference is that it’s open-source, meaning anyone can see its code, improve it, and customize it. That’s why it’s used everywhere:

In Android phones

In smart devices like TVs, cars, and appliances 

On the world’s fastest supercomputers 

On powerful servers that run websites and apps
