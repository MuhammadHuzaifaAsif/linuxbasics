🌍 Where is Linux Used?

Linux is everywhere — even if you don’t realize it. While it might feel more technical than Windows or macOS, it quietly powers much of the modern world. Examples include:

Websites & Servers 🌐 – Most websites you visit are hosted on Linux servers.

Cars 🚗 – Infotainment and control panels often run on Linux-based systems.

Shops & Retail 🛒 – Point of Sale (PoS) systems like checkout tills and registers.

Critical Infrastructure 🚦 – Things like traffic lights, industrial sensors, and smart utilities.

Everyday Devices 📱 – Android phones, smart TVs, and even home appliances.

👉 Odds are, you interact with Linux multiple times every single day!

🐧 Flavours of Linux (Distributions)

When people say Linux, they don’t mean just one operating system. Linux is the kernel (the core of the OS), and on top of it people build different versions called distributions (distros).

Because Linux is open-source, anyone can modify and create their own distro.

Each distro is designed with a purpose — lightweight, secure, user-friendly, or specialized.

Common Examples

Ubuntu & Debian → Very popular, user-friendly, can be used as a desktop or a server.

Fedora & Red Hat → Often used in enterprise environments.

Kali Linux → Used in cybersecurity and penetration testing.

Arch Linux → Minimal and customizable, for advanced users.

👉 For this series, we’ll be using Ubuntu, since it’s one of the most common and beginner-friendly.
Fun fact: Ubuntu Server can run on as little as 512MB of RAM – showing just how lightweight Linux can be.

💡 Analogy

Think of Linux distributions like versions of Windows:

Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11 are all Windows, but they look and behave slightly differently.

Similarly, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Arch are all Linux, but with different designs, tools, and purposes.
