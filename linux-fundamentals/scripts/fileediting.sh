# Up until now, you‚Äôve been putting text into files with echo and > or >>.
# That works for short stuff, but if you want to write longer text or edit existing files, you need a text editor inside the terminal.

# There are two popular ones:

# 1. Nano (Beginner-Friendly Editor)

# Very easy to use.

# To open (or create) a file:

# nano filename


Example:

nano myfile


# Once it opens:

# You can just type text directly.

# Use the arrow keys to move around.

# To save: CTRL + O (think: ‚ÄúO‚Äù for Output/write).

# To exit: CTRL + X.

# At the bottom of nano you‚Äôll see shortcuts like ^X (which means CTRL+X).

# 2. VIM (Advanced Editor)

# Very powerful but harder to learn at first.

# Has modes (like insert mode for typing, command mode for editing/saving).

# Developers love it because it has:

# Syntax highlighting (colors for code).

# Tons of customizations.

# Works on nearly every Linux system.

üëâ For now, use Nano because it‚Äôs simple. Later, if you want to be a pro, you can learn VIM.
