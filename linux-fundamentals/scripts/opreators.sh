#🖥️ 1. & (Run in Background)

#👉 Think of it like telling Linux: "Do this, but don’t bother me while you’re busy."
#You can keep working on other stuff while the command runs in the background.

#Example:

cp bigfile.zip /tmp &


#This copies a big file in the background.

#You can still type other commands while it’s working.

#🖥️ 2. && (Do This AND Then That)

#👉 Think of it like "if the first thing works, then do the second."
#It’s like a checklist.

#Example:

mkdir test && cd test


#First: makes a folder named test.

#If that works, then: moves into the folder.

#If the first fails, the second won’t run.

#🖥️ 3. > (Send Output to a File — Replace Contents)

#👉 Think of it like "write this into a file (but erase what was there before)."

#Example:

echo hello > file.txt


#Creates file.txt (or clears it if it already exists).

#Puts the word hello inside.

#Check it:

cat file.txt
# Output: hello


#If file.txt had something before, it’s gone — replaced.

#🖥️ 4. >> (Send Output to a File — Add at the End)

#👉 Think of it like "don’t erase, just add this to the bottom."

#Example:

echo world >> file.txt


#Now check the file again:

cat file.txt
# Output:
hello
world


#Instead of replacing, it just adds to the end.

#✅ In simple words:

& = run in the background.

&& = do this AND then that (if first succeeds).

> = write to a file (overwrite).

>> = write to a file (append / add).
