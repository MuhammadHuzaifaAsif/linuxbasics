# ðŸ“‚ /etc

# Think of this as the settings folder for your whole computer.

# It has things like who the users are (passwd),

# their secret codes (shadow),

# and who is allowed to run admin commands (sudoers).

# ðŸ“‚ /var

# This is the busy work folder.

# It stores things that are always changing (variable).

# Like logs of whatâ€™s happening, temporary app data, and background info for services.

# ðŸ“‚ /root

# This is the personal home folder for the boss user (root).

# Normal users live in /home/username,

# but the root admin lives here in /root.

# ðŸ“‚ /tmp

# This is like the scratch pad folder.

# Anyone can put files here,

# but it gets wiped clean every reboot.

# Hackers often drop their tools here since itâ€™s open for everyone.

# ðŸ‘‰ So in everyday words:

# /etc = Settings folder

# /var = Busy data folder

# /root = Bossâ€™s home folder

/tmp = Scratch pad
